### ***Description***
#### SoftSchedule is your gentle companion in the chaos of everyday life. It’s a to-do list app built not just for productivity, but for peace of mind. You can easily create, update, and organize your tasks without feeling overwhelmed. The interface is warm and calming—like a cozy corner where your plans feel safe, not stressful. It includes a calendar with quotes, goal tracking, book management, to-do lists, and a diary with mood tracking. Users can sign up, log in, and manage their daily tasks, reading progress, and reflections all in one simple and clean interface.
